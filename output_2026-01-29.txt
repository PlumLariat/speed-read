Atmospheric motion: principles

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

When you have read this chapter you will be able to define the geostrophic wind, know the basic laws of horizontal motion in the atmosphere, know how the Coriolis force arises and its effects, know how friction modifies wind velocity in the boundary layer, understand the principles of divergence/convergence and vorticity and their roles in atmospheric processes, and understand the thermodynamic, dynamic and topographic factors that lead to distinctive local wind regimes.

The atmosphere is in constant motion on scales ranging from short-lived, local wind gusts to storm systems spanning several thousand kilometers and lasting about a week, and to the more or less constant global-scale wind belts circling the earth. Before considering the global aspects, however, it is important to look at the immediate controls on air motion. The downward-acting gravitational field of the earth sets up the observed decrease of pressure away from the earth’s surface that is represented in the vertical distribution of atmospheric mass. This mutual balance between the force of gravity and the vertical pressure gradient is referred to as hydrostatic equilibrium. This state of balance, together with the general stability of the atmosphere and its shallow depth, greatly limits vertical air motion. Average horizontal wind speeds are of the order of 100 times greater than average vertical movements, although individual exceptions occur, particularly in convective storms.

LAWS OF HORIZONTAL MOTION

There are four controls on the horizontal movement of air near the earth’s surface: the pressure-gradient force, the Coriolis force, centripetal acceleration, and frictional forces. The primary cause of air movement is the development of a horizontal pressure gradient through spatial differences in surface heating and consequent changes in air density and pressure. The fact that such a gradient can persist, rather than being destroyed by air motion towards the low pressure, results from the effect of the earth’s rotation in giving rise to the Coriolis force.

1 The pressure-gradient force

The pressure-gradient force has vertical and horizontal components but, as already noted, the vertical component is more or less in balance with the force of gravity. Horizontal differences in pressure arise from thermal heating contrasts or mechanical causes such as mountain barriers and these differences control the horizontal movement of an air mass. The horizontal pressure gradient serves as the motivating force that causes air to move from areas of high pressure towards areas where it is lower, although other forces prevent air from moving directly across the isobars. The pressure-gradient force per unit mass is expressed mathematically as (1/p) * (dp/dn) where p equals air density and dp/dn equals the horizontal gradient of pressure. Hence the closer the isobar spacing the more intense is the pressure gradient and the greater the wind speed. The pressure-gradient force is also inversely proportional to air density, and this relationship is of particular importance in understanding the behavior of upper winds.

2 The earth’s rotational deflective (Coriolis) force

The Coriolis force arises from the fact that the movement of masses over the earth’s surface is referenced to a moving coordinate system, such as the latitude and longitude grid, which rotates with the earth. The simplest way to visualize how this deflecting force operates is to picture a rotating disc on which moving objects are deflected. The body follows a straight path in relation to a fixed frame of reference, but viewed relative to coordinates rotating with the disc the body swings to the right of its initial line of motion. This effect is readily demonstrated if a pencil line is drawn across a white disc on a rotating turntable. In the case of the rotating earth, there is apparent deflection of moving objects to the right of their line of motion in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, as viewed by observers on the earth. The idea of a deflective force is credited to the work of French mathematician G.G. Coriolis in the 1830s. The force per unit mass is expressed by 2ΩV sin φ where Ω equals the angular velocity (7.29 x 10^-5 radians per second), φ equals the latitude and V equals the velocity of the mass. 2Ω sin φ is referred to as the Coriolis parameter (f). Angular velocity is a vector representing the rate of rotation of an object about the axis of rotation; its magnitude is the time rate of displacement of any point of the body.

The magnitude of the deflection is directly proportional to the horizontal velocity of the air and the sine of the latitude. The effect is thus a maximum at the poles where the plane of the deflecting force is parallel to the earth’s surface. It decreases with the sine of the latitude, becoming zero at the equator where there is no component of the deflection in a plane parallel to the surface. The Coriolis force depends on the motion itself. Hence, it affects the direction but not the speed of the air motion, which would involve doing work. The Coriolis force always acts at right angles to the direction of the air motion, to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Absolute values of f vary with latitude from 0 at the equator to 1.458 x 10^-4 per second at the poles. The earth’s rotation also produces a vertical component of rotation about a horizontal axis. This is a maximum at the equator and causes a vertical deflection upward or downward for horizontal west/east winds. However, this effect is of secondary importance due to the existence of hydrostatic equilibrium.

3 The geostrophic wind

Observations in the free atmosphere, above the level affected by surface friction at about 500 to 1000m, show that the wind blows more or less at right angles to the pressure gradient, parallel to the isobars, with high pressure on the right and low pressure on the left in the Northern Hemisphere when viewed downwind. This implies that for steady motion the pressure-gradient force is exactly balanced by the Coriolis deflection acting in the diametrically opposite direction. The wind in this idealized case is called a geostrophic wind, the velocity (Vg) of which is given by the formula Vg = (1 / (f * p)) * (dp/dn). The velocity is inversely dependent on latitude, such that the same pressure gradient associated with a geostrophic wind speed of 15 meters per second at latitude 43 degrees will produce a velocity of only 10 meters per second at latitude 90 degrees. Except in low latitudes, where the Coriolis parameter approaches zero, the geostrophic wind is a close approximation to the observed air motion in the free atmosphere. Since pressure systems are rarely stationary, this fact implies that air motion must continually change towards a new balance. In other words, mutual adjustments of the wind and pressure fields are constantly taking place. The common cause-and-effect argument that a pressure gradient is formed and air begins to move towards low pressure before coming into geostrophic balance is an unfortunate oversimplification of reality.

4 The centripetal acceleration

For a body to follow a curved path there must be an inward acceleration (c) towards the center of rotation. This is expressed by c = V^2 / r where V equals its velocity and r equals the radius of curvature. This effect is sometimes regarded for convenience as a centrifugal force operating radially outward. In the case of the earth itself, this is valid. The centrifugal effect due to rotation has in fact resulted in a slight bulging of the earth’s mass in low latitudes and a flattening near the poles. The small decrease in apparent gravity towards the equator reflects the effect of the centrifugal force working against the gravitational attraction directed towards the earth’s center. It is therefore only necessary to consider the forces involved in the rotation of the air around a local axis of high or low pressure. Here the curved path of the air is maintained by an inward-acting, or centripetal, acceleration. In a low pressure system balanced flow is maintained in a curved path, referred to as the gradient wind, by the Coriolis force being weaker than the pressure force. The difference between the two gives the net centripetal acceleration inward. In the high pressure case, the inward acceleration exists because the Coriolis force exceeds the pressure force. Since the pressure gradients are assumed to be equal, the different contributions of the Coriolis force in each case imply that the wind speed around the low pressure must be lower than the geostrophic value, whereas in the case of high pressure it is supergeostrophic. In reality, this effect is obscured by the fact that the pressure gradient in a high is usually much weaker than in a low. Moreover, the fact that the earth’s rotation is cyclonic imposes a limit on the speed of anticyclonic flow. The maximum occurs when the angular velocity is f/2, at which value the absolute rotation of the air is just cyclonic. Beyond this point anticyclonic flow breaks down. There is no maximum speed in the case of cyclonic rotation.

The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is generally small, but it becomes important where high-velocity winds are moving in very curved paths around an intense low pressure vortex. Two cases are of meteorological significance: first, in intense cyclones near the equator, where the Coriolis force is negligible; and, second, in a narrow vortex such as a tornado. Under these conditions, when the large pressure-gradient force provides the necessary centripetal acceleration for balanced flow parallel to the isobars, the motion is called cyclostrophic. The above arguments assume steady conditions of balanced flow. This simplification is useful, but in reality two factors prevent a continuous state of balance. Latitudinal motion changes the Coriolis parameter, and the movement or changing intensity of a pressure system leads to acceleration or deceleration of the air, causing some degree of cross-isobaric flow. Pressure change itself depends on air displacement through the breakdown of the balanced state. If air movement were purely geostrophic there would be no growth or decay of pressure systems. The acceleration of air at upper levels from a region of cyclonic isobaric curvature to one of anticyclonic curvature causes a fall of pressure at lower levels in the atmosphere to compensate for the removal of air aloft. The interaction of horizontal and vertical air motions is essential to this process. In cases where the curvature of the flow is tight, as near the eye of a tropical cyclone, the centripetal acceleration may balance the pressure gradient force; the resulting wind is termed cyclostrophic.

5 Frictional forces and the planetary boundary layer

The last force that has an important effect on air movement is that due to friction from the earth’s surface. Towards the surface, typically below about 500m for flat terrain, friction due to form drag over orography begins to reduce the wind velocity below its geostrophic value. This slowing of the wind near the surface modifies the deflective force, which is dependent on velocity, causing it also to decrease. Initially, the frictional force is opposite to the wind velocity, but in a balanced state the vector sum of the Coriolis and friction components balances the pressure gradient force. Thus, at low levels, due to frictional effects, the wind blows obliquely across the isobars in the direction of the pressure-gradient. The angle of obliqueness increases with the growing effect of frictional drag due to the earth’s surface averaging about 10 to 20 degrees at the surface over the sea and 25 to 35 degrees over land. In summary, the surface wind represents a balance between the pressure-gradient force and the Coriolis force perpendicular to the air motion, and friction roughly parallel, but opposite, to the air motion. Where the Coriolis force is small, friction may balance the pressure gradient force and the wind, known as antitriptic, flows down the pressure gradient.

The layer of frictional influence is known as the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Atmospheric profilers can routinely measure the temporal variability of PBL structure. Its depth varies over land from a few hundred meters at night, when the air is stable as a result of nocturnal surface cooling, to 1 to 2km during afternoon convective conditions. Over the oceans it is more consistently near 1km deep and in the tropics especially is often capped by an inversion due to sinking air. The boundary layer is typically either stable or unstable. Yet, for theoretical convenience, it is often treated as being neutrally stable. For this ideal state, the wind turns clockwise with increased height above the surface, setting up an Ekman spiral. The inflow of air towards the low pressure center generates upward motion at the top of the PBL, known as Ekman pumping. Wind velocity decreases exponentially close to the earth’s surface due to frictional effects. These consist of form drag over obstacles and the frictional stress exerted by the air at the surface interface. The mechanism of form drag involves the creation of locally higher pressure on the windward side of an obstacle and a lateral pressure gradient. Wind stress arises from molecular resistance and turbulent eddies. The aerodynamic roughness of terrain is described by the roughness length, or height at which the wind speed falls to zero based on extrapolation of the neutral wind profile. Turbulence in the atmosphere is generated by the vertical change in wind velocity, known as a vertical wind shear, and is suppressed by an absence of buoyancy. The Richardson number provides a measure of dynamic stability. Above a critical threshold, turbulence is likely to occur.

DIVERGENCE, VERTICAL MOTION AND VORTICITY

These three terms are the key to proper understanding of wind and pressure systems on a synoptic and global scale. Mass uplift or descent of air occurs primarily in response to dynamic factors related to horizontal airflow and is only secondarily affected by air-mass stability.

1 Divergence

Air may accelerate or decelerate, leading to velocity divergence or convergence. When streamlines spread out or squeeze together, this is termed diffluence or confluence, respectively. If the streamline pattern is strengthened by that of the isotachs, there may be mass divergence or convergence at a point. In this case, the compressibility of the air causes the density to decrease or increase, respectively. Usually, however, confluence is associated with an increase in air velocity and diffluence with a decrease. In the intermediate case, confluence is balanced by an increase in wind velocity and diffluence by a decrease in velocity. Hence, convergence or divergence may give rise to vertical stretching or shrinking. It is important to note that if all winds were geostrophic, there could be no convergence or divergence and hence no weather. Convergence or divergence may also occur as a result of frictional effects. Onshore winds undergo convergence at low levels when the air slows down on crossing the coastline owing to the greater friction overland, whereas offshore winds accelerate and become divergent. Frictional differences can also set up coastal convergence if the geostrophic wind is parallel to the coastline.

2 Vertical motion

Horizontal inflow or outflow near the surface has to be compensated by vertical motion if the low or high pressure systems are to persist and there is to be no continuous density increase or decrease. Air rises above a low pressure cell and subsides over high pressure, with compensating divergence and convergence in the upper troposphere. In the middle troposphere, there must clearly be some level at which horizontal divergence or convergence is effectively zero; the mean level of non-divergence is generally at about 600mb. Large-scale vertical motion is extremely slow compared with convective up- and downdrafts in cumulus clouds. Typical rates in large depressions and anticyclones are of the order of 5 to 10 centimeters per second, whereas updrafts in cumulus may exceed 10 meters per second.

3 Vorticity

Vorticity implies the rotation, or angular velocity, of small parcels in any fluid. The air within a low pressure system may be regarded as comprising an infinite number of small air parcels, each rotating cyclonically around an axis vertical to the earth’s surface. Vorticity has three elements: magnitude, direction, and the sense of rotation. Rotation in the same sense as the earth’s rotation, cyclonic in the Northern Hemisphere, is defined as positive. Cyclonic vorticity may result from cyclonic curvature of the streamlines, from cyclonic shear with stronger winds on the right side of the current, or a combination of the two. Lateral shear results from changes in isobar spacing. Anticyclonic vorticity occurs with the corresponding anticyclonic situation. The component of vorticity around an axis vertical to the earth’s surface is referred to as the vertical vorticity. This is generally the most important, but near the ground surface frictional shear causes vorticity around an axis parallel to the surface and normal to the wind direction. Vorticity is related not only to air motion around a cyclone or anticyclone, but also to the location of that system on the rotating earth. The vertical component of absolute vorticity consists of the relative vorticity and the latitudinal value of the Coriolis parameter. At the equator, the local vertical is at right angles to the earth’s axis, so f equals 0, but at the North Pole cyclonic relative vorticity and the earth’s rotation act in the same sense.

LOCAL WINDS

For a weather observer, local controls of air movement may present more problems than the effects of the major planetary forces. Diurnal tendencies are superimposed upon both the large- and the small-scale patterns of wind velocity. These are particularly noticeable in the case of local winds. Under normal conditions, wind velocities tend to be least about dawn when there is little vertical thermal mixing and the lower air is less affected by the velocity of the air aloft. Conversely, velocities of some local winds are greatest around early afternoon when the air is most subject to terrestrial heating and vertical motion, thereby enabling coupling to the upper air movement. Air always moves more freely away from the surface because it is not subject to the retarding effects of friction and obstruction.

1 Mountain and valley winds

Terrain features give rise to their own special meteorological conditions. On warm, sunny days, the heated air in a valley is laterally constricted compared with that over an equivalent area of lowland and so tends to expand vertically. This difference in heating sets up a density and pressure differential, which causes air to flow from the lowland up the axis of the valley. This valley wind is generally light and requires a weak regional pressure gradient in order to develop. This flow along the main valley develops more or less simultaneously with anabatic winds, which result from greater heating of the valley sides compared with the valley floor. These slope winds rise above the ridge tops and feed an upper return current along the line of the valley. Speeds reach a maximum around 14:00 hours. At night, there is a reverse process as denser cold air at higher elevations drains into depressions and valleys; this is known as a katabatic wind. If the air drains downslope into an open valley, a mountain wind develops simultaneously along the axis of the valley. This flows towards the plain, where it replaces warmer, less dense air. The maximum velocity occurs just before sunrise at the time of maximum diurnal cooling. As with the valley wind, an upper return current also overlies the mountain wind. Katabatic drainage is usually cited as the cause of frost pockets in hilly and mountainous areas. Cold air pockets in valley bottoms and hollows probably result from the cessation of turbulent heat transfer to the surface in sheltered locations rather than by cold air drainage, which is often not present.

2 Land and sea breezes

Another thermally induced wind regime is the land and sea breezes. The vertical expansion of the air column that occurs during daytime heating over the more rapidly heated land tilts the isobaric surfaces downward at the coast, causing onshore winds at the surface and a compensating offshore movement aloft. Typical land-sea pressure differences are of the order of 2mb. At night, the air over the sea is warmer and the situation is reversed, although this reversal is also the effect of downslope winds blowing off the land. Sea breezes can have a decisive effect on temperature and humidity. The advancing cool sea air may form a distinct line or front marked by cumulus cloud development, behind which there is a distinct wind velocity maximum. In mid-latitudes the Coriolis deflection causes turning of a well-developed onshore sea breeze so that eventually it may blow more or less parallel to the shore. Analogous lake breeze systems develop adjacent to large inland water bodies. Small-scale circulations can be generated by local differences in albedo and thermal conductivity. Salt flats, for example, cause an off-playa breeze by day and an on-playa flow at night due to differential heating and high thermal conductivity relative to the surrounding sandy terrain.

3 Winds due to topographic barriers

Mountain ranges strongly influence airflow crossing them. On the upwind side of mountains perpendicular to the airflow, blocking may occur when the airflow is stable and unable to cross the barrier. As the flow approaches the barrier it slows down, thus reducing the Coriolis force. Imbalance with the pressure gradient force then causes the air to turn poleward towards the lower pressure on the left side of the flow. This sets up a low-level barrier wind. The displacement of air upward over an obstacle may trigger instability if the air is conditionally unstable and buoyant, whereas stable air returns to its original level in the lee of a barrier as the gravitational effect counteracts the initial displacement. This descent often forms the first of a series of lee waves downwind. The wave form remains more or less stationary relative to the barrier, with the air moving quite rapidly through it. Below the crest of the waves, there may be circular air motion in a vertical plane, which is termed a rotor. Winds on mountain summits are usually strong. Airflow over a mountain range causes the air below the tropopause to be compressed and thus accelerated particularly at and near the crest line, although friction with the ground also retards the flow. The net result is predominantly one of retardation, but the outcome depends on the topography, wind direction and stability. Over low hills, the boundary layer is displaced upward and acceleration occurs just above the summit.

A wind of local importance near mountain areas is the foehn, or chinook. It is a strong, gusty, dry and warm wind that develops on the lee side of a mountain range when stable air is forced to flow across the barrier by the regional pressure gradient; the air descending on the lee slope warms adiabatically. Sometimes there is a loss of moisture by precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. The air, having cooled at the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, subsequently warms at the greater dry adiabatic lapse rate as it descends on the lee side. This also reduces both the relative and the absolute humidity. In many instances the foehn effect is the result of the blocking of air to windward of the mountains by a summit-level temperature inversion. This forces air from higher levels to descend and warm adiabatically. Southerly foehn winds are common along the northern flanks of the Alps and the Caucasus in winter and spring. In some parts of the world, winds descending on the lee slope of a mountain range are colder than the air they displace despite adiabatic warming through descent. The type example of such fall-winds is the bora of the northern Adriatic, where cold northeasterly flows cross the Dinaric Alps. These winds occur when cold continental air masses are forced across a mountain range by the pressure gradient and displace warmer air. Locally, at the foot of the mountains, such winds may attain hurricane force. Extreme amplification of a lee wave can drag air from above the summit level down to the plains over a short distance, leading to high velocities.

Air motion is described by its horizontal and vertical components; the latter are much smaller than the horizontal velocities. Horizontal motions compensate for vertical imbalances between gravitational acceleration and the vertical pressure gradient. The horizontal pressure gradient, the earth’s rotational effect, and the curvature of the isobars determine horizontal wind velocity. All three factors are accounted for in the gradient wind equation, but this can be approximated in large-scale flow by the geostrophic wind relationship. Below 1500m, the wind speed and direction are affected by surface friction. Air ascends or descends in association with surface convergence or divergence of air. Air motion is also subject to relative vertical vorticity as a result of curvature of the streamlines and lateral shear; this, together with the earth’s rotational effect, makes up the absolute vertical vorticity. Local winds occur as a result of diurnally varying thermal differences setting up local pressure gradients or due to the effect of a topographic barrier on airflow crossing it.
